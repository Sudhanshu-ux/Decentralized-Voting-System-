# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based voting platform that allows users to vote securely and transparently on candidates without relying on a centralized authority. The smart contract manages candidates and votes, ensuring immutability and preventing double voting.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a trustless and transparent voting mechanism that can be used for community elections, organizational decision-making, and any scenario requiring fair and auditable voting.

## Key Features
- **Admin-controlled candidate registration:** Only the admin can add candidates to the system.
- **One-person, one-vote:** Prevents double voting by tracking voters.
- **Public vote counts:** Anyone can view the current vote counts for candidates.
- **Event logging:** Emits events for votes cast to enable easy tracking.

## Future Scope
- Implement voter registration and verification.
- Enable vote delegation and weighted voting.
- Develop a front-end UI for easier interaction.
- Integrate with decentralized identity solutions.
- Add support for multiple voting rounds and proposals.
